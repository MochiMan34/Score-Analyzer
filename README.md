# Score-Analyzer

Basic coding assingment I had to do. The assignment was to create a program that accepted an undisclosed amount of numerical scores; with 100 being the 
max value. The program had to print out how many scores of the scores entered where above the average score, and how many were below the average of 
all scores entered.
